<p>Indulging in new topics and refining my skillset are two key aspects for my intrinsic motivation.  I love gaining insights and aquiring an overview over a broad spectrum of topics. The IT-Sector provides me with the of knowledge and skills that fullfill & challenge me every day.  I believe that communicating and sharing knowledge are invaluable pillars for growth of society.</p>
<p>Some more personal information about me can be found at <a href="#">A propos</a> or here below:
My passion for food and cooking has led me to study horticulture where I learned about producing quality organic produce, the balance of ecosystems and lifecycles of plants & insects. As one of my many side quests I had the opportunity to thoroughly learn about Olive Oil, Olive Mills, Olive Trees and the overall culture surrounding Olive Oils. This quest lead me to different producers and institutions throughout the Mediterranean and even all the way to California where I got to taste Olive Oils from both Americas & Oceania.</p>
